#My Dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles. There are many like it, but this one is mine. It is small, but overtime it will grow into something much bigger.

It features a nicely formatted bash prompt, based off of [Barry Clark's great work](https://github.com/barryclark/bashstrap).

There is also a collection of simple aliases for being more efficient with Git.
